Nimble Logging
--------------

1 message of info or higher for each transaction, whatever a transaction is defined as,
with as much useful information about what was done, who it was done by,
and what the outcome was, as possible.


How to use log levels
---------------------

Error - errors relating to application state that is caused by some internal problem
might be an internal library throwing an exception or something horribly wrong with the application state

Warn - An error you'd expect in general flow if the user is doing something stupid and should be notified

Info - success states for user interactions

Debug - specific details on steps the application is taking

Trace - Low level information, raw request/responses from other systems, etc
